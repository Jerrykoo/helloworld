Hi there,

Finding a meaningful R code written by someone from LinkedIn, I finally start to do something in GitHub here, registered some time ago. Lucky for me and Github! LOL

Why is there a repository called 'jerrycreatesthisandthat'? Because I suppose jerry will, if not here in Github, creates this and that everywhere! Explosive bang!

By the way, I just got ditched by a staff in a coffee chat. Get used to it afterward maybe.
